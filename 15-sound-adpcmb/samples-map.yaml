# This file holds references to all the ADPCM samples
# that are used in this example ROM.
# It is processed by vromtool.py to assign a position
# to all samples in the VROM, and generate a series of
# ASM defines to export offsets to the sound driver.
#
# Each entry is either a 'adpcm_a' or 'adpcm_b', and
# it must include a name and a uri field.
# uri can either be:
#   file://XXX to reference a file on disk
#   data:;base64,XXX to inline ADPCM data
#
- adpcm_b:
    name: beat
    uri: file://samples/beat.adpcmb
- adpcm_b:
    name: dance
    uri: file://samples/dance.adpcmb
